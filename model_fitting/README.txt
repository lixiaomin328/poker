\f0\fs24 \cf0 This package contains function needed to estimate hide and seek game with saliency perturbation as well as quantal response equilibrium solution for the same problem.\
\
All .m files are functions needed. \
solveQRE.m and modelfitting.m are two main functions one wants to run.\
\
.mat files are sample data which can always be replaced by your own data.\
All data are transformed into 20 units bins density map for estimation. \
