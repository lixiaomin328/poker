The Matlab script fitparam can be used for parameterization of 
connectionist models of cognitive processes. To see how to use it,
type in Matlab: "help fitparam", and to see an example, type:
"fitparam('example');"

The details of the parameterization method, used by fitparam, are
described in fire: report.pdf

In the directory "example", a more detailed example of parameteriza-
tion of the Erikson model is described. See example\ReadMe.txt

fitparam uses the MATLAB implementation of the SUBPLEX algorithm, a
generalization of the Nelder-Mead Simplex method which is well suited
for use on noisy functions with large numbers of parameters.  The
following files should be included:

README                  partitionx.m            simplex.m
about_subplex.m         partitionx_rec.m        subplex.m
do_options.m            prodsqr.m               subplex_options.m

For execution, the files README, prodsqr.m, and partitionx_rec.m are
not necessary.

	The prodsqr.m is a simple sum of squares function which is
useful for testing the subplex code.
	The partitionx_rec.m file is a recursive implementation of the
partitionx.m file.  While it is not used, it is included to improve
the clarity of the purpose of partitionx.m  It was not used to
preserve compatibility between the FORTRAN and MATLAB version.

To test this code, simply run matlab and type 

x = subplex('prodsqr',[10 10 10 10])

If all elements of x are close to zero, the routine is working
properly.
